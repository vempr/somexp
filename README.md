# v-log: ðŸš€ Astro + Chiri ðŸŒ¸

My minimal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build), and the Chiri theme. v-log was created shortly after the final ship of my Summer of Making project libsim. I wanted to give my thoughts on the experience and chose to use Astro as an opportunity to learn this framework.

## Commands for future me

- `pnpm new <title>` - Create a new post (use `_title` for drafts)
- `pnpm update-theme` - Update the theme to the latest version
