On the 16th of June 2025, I got a newsletter from GitHub:

>  GitHub is joining Hack Club for *Summer of Making* 2025!
> Code this summer to earn incredible prizes: Framework Laptops, Raspberry Pis, Cricut Cutters, Flipper Zeros, Bambu 3D Printers, and so much more.
> Here's how it works:
> 1. Code on personal projects to earn shells
> 2. Spend your shells on prizes from Pis to Pinecils
> 3. Repeat until August 31st

I was already working on [libsim](https://github.com/vempr/libsim), my biggest project at that time, so why not log my time and get some cool prizes along the way?

## Learning PHP

I had learnt PHP with Jeffrey Way's amazing beginner course on Laracasts in preparation to build my best project with Laravel. The stack I chose was **Laravel + React + SQLite**, since I felt most comfortable building my UI with React.

Now reflecting on the project, I really should have chosen another database system instead of SQLite for much better scalibility, but it made the deployment very simple.

I wasn't the best at designing beautiful interfaces, so I found a really cool TailwindCSS theme on [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com).

## The First 25% of libsim

After a long and full period of school happenings, I finally found time to commit to this project. It had been a few months since I learnt PHP and Laravel basics, but I quickly got used to the framework's architecture.

The entirety of May was spent building a solid foundation for the API, with little focus on the frontend. I was not rushing to finish libsim quickly, since I had more than 2 months to finish it before going abroad for 6 weeks. Time went by, and then **Summer of Making** started!

## Accelerating

I somehow managed to managed to log <u>60 hours</u> of VSCode in three weeks while finishing up my application. It was during my internship too, which was not an ideal combination for my mental health. Nevertheless, I accelerated my building speed and was able to ship a *buggy but very proud* project before my flight!

In total, I shipped 23 devlogs with each one averaging 2.6 hours.

![Week 1: 22.5 hours, Week 2: 26.8 hours, Week 3: 10.7 hours](./assets/hackatime.jpg)

The project got rejected 2 times and it took additional 3.5 hours for me to fix it up before finally getting that ship certification ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I received 992 coins as my reward, which is around the average amount this project should give:

$$
\begin{equation}
coins = 15 * hours
\end{equation}
$$

The multiplier ranges from 1 to 30, depending on how many votes the project gets.

## The Community

I had a lot of fun talking to other participants in Summer of Making, as well as seeing the various projects that people have built in those months. They were all supportive and I would like to thank the Hack Club team for supporting teenagers like me, who love building stuff.
